# 3D VAE implementations

Pytorch implementations of 3D VAE supposedly used for CT/MRI.

Two models are defined here. 

* Vanilla VAE (SimpleVAE3D), where I only use 3D conv/deconv modules
* VAE using inception module. Inspired by [this blog post by koshian2 (Written in Japanese)] (https://qiita.com/koshian2/items/e2d05d9151f5ae9deefb)
